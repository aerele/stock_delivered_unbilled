## Stock Delivered Unbilled

Like **Stock Received But Not Billed** in the Purchase Cycle, this app will enable the same scenario but in the Sales Cycle (**Stock Delivered But Not Billed**) when a delivery note is made but not yet billed.


- Once the Delivery Note is submitted, 1000 SAR (as an example amount) is credited to the Stock Account and 1000 SAR is debited to the **Stock Delivered but Not Billed** Account.
- Once the Sales Invoice is submitted, 1000 SAR is credited to the **Stock Delivered but Not Billed** Account, and 1000 SAR is debited to the **Cost Of Goods Sold** Account.
- Due to back-dated stock entry, if Repost Item Valuation is created against entries in point 1, entries in point 2 will be reposted too.

**Stock Delivered but Not Billed Account** (an Asset type account) is configurable in the Company doctype like Stock Received But Not Billed.
